## 1. SOM Packages Functionality

### 1.1 Basic Plots
- [ ] Color Higtogram: Single number (different color maps as arg)
- [ ] hit histogram & complex hit hist (combine them in one plot function): Size of the histogram and interior color of histogram and edge color.
- [ ] U map (neuron dist plot)
- [ ] Multiple plot (anuy plot in each hex) pie, bar, stem, etc.
- [ ] Right click on the cluster to see the cluster information
    - [ ] Plot the cluster center (line or image)
    - [ ] Plot / list the 5 closet inputs to the cluster center

### 1.2 Subclustering
- [ ] Train a subcluster -> Save som and json mapping

### 1.3 Distance Functions
- [ ] Euclidean
- [ ] Manhattan
- [ ] Cosine
- [ ] Chebyshev

### 1.4 Neighborhood Functions
- [ ] Gaussian
- [ ] Bubble
- [ ] Mexican Hat
- [ ] Triangle

### 1.5 Save and Load
- [ ] Save the trained SOM as pickle
- [ ] Load the trained SOM as pickle

### 1.6 Interactive Plots
- [ ] Implement interactive plots with Plotly

### 1.7 CuPy 
- [ ] Implement CuPy for faster computation

### 1.8 Documentation
- [ ] Add documentation to the functions

## 2. SOM Packages Testing

### 2.1 Test the SOM packages with some example datasets with labels
- [ ] Test the SOM packages with some example datasets with labels

### 2.2 Train a model and make prediction
- [ ] Train the SOM with some example datasets without labels and make prediction

### 2.3 Post Training Analysis
- [ ] Analyze the trained SOM with some example datasets
