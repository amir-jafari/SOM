Welcome to NNSOM's documentation!
=================================

NNSOM is a Python library that provides an implementation of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) using NumPy and CuPy.
SOM is a type of Artificial Neural Network that can transform complex, nonlinear statistical relationships between high-dimensional data into simple topological relationships on a low-dimensional display (typically 2-dimensional).

The library is designed with two main goals in mind:

- Extensibility: NNSOM aims to provide a solid foundation for researchers to build upon and extend its functionality according to their specific requirements.
- Educational Value: The implementation is structured in a way that allows students to quickly understand the inner workings of SOM, fostering a better grasp of the algorithm's details.

With NNSOM, researchers and students alike can leverage the power of SOM for various applications, such as data visualization, clustering, and dimensionality reduction, while benefiting from the flexibility and educational value offered by this library.

Visit the :doc:`installation page <installing>` to see how you can download the package and get started with it. You can browse the :doc:`Tutorials <examples>` to see some of the things that you can do with NNSOM,
and then check out the :doc:`NNSOM package <modules>` to find out how.
